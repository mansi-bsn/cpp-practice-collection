// 15. Write a C++ program that asks the user to enter positive integers in order to process count, maximum, minimum, and average or terminate the process with -1.
// Sample Output:
// Your input is for termination. Here is the result below:
// Number of positive integers is: 4
// The maximum value is: 9
// The minimum value is: 3
// The average is 6.00

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int n;
    cout << "Enter a positive integer or -1 to terminate: ";
    cin >> n;
